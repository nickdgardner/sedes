# When we are attaching Unicode combining characters to a base character, we
# need to take care with certain diacritics so that they normalize into NFC
# nicely. The basic rule is that we want to sort these three diacritics:
#   ( ) +
# before these three:
#   / \ =
# Getting the order wrong prevents full NFC composition. For example, `i(/`,
# after decoding and normalizing, becomes the single character
#   1F35 GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH DASIA AND OXIA
# But `i/(`, if the diacritics were kept in that order, normalizes only
# partially:
#   03AF GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH TONOS
#   0314 COMBINING REVERSED COMMA ABOVE
#
# The ordering rule is a consequence of how canonical equivalence is defined for
# Greek characters (https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0370.pdf#page=2). Take
# for example 0390 GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH DIALYTIKA AND TONOS. 0390 is
# canonically equivalent to 03CA GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH DIALYTIKA +
# 0301 COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT. 03CA is itself canonically equivalent to
# 03B9 GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA + 0308 COMBINING DIAERESIS.
#   0390 ≡ 03CA + 0301
#   03CA ≡ 03B9 + 0308
# Applying these equivalencies in reverse, 03B9 + 0308 + 0301 composes properly
# into 0390. But no such chain of equivalencies leads to 0390 if we start with
# the opposite order of diacritics, 03B9 + 0301 + 0308. By applying the
# canonical equivalence rule
#   03AF ≡ 03B9 + 0301
# we can get as far as 03AF GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH TONOS + 0308 COMBINING
# DIAERESIS, but from there, no further composition is possible.
#
# The order of diacritics only matters for those with the same canonical
# combining class. ( ) + / \ = all map to Unicode characters with a combining
# class of 230. The relative order of ? and | does not matter, as they map to
# characters with combining classes of 220 and 240 respectively. For
# consistency, we sort these in order of combining class, which is the same
# order that Unicode normalization would put them in.
